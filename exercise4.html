<h1>DON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME SONGTEXT </h1>
<section>
<p>
	I can't <span><em>light</em></span> no more of your darkness <br>
	All my pictures seem to fade to black and white <br>
	I'm growing tired and time stands still before me<br>
	Frozen here on the ladder of my life
</p>
</section>

<section>
	<p>Too late to save myself from falling <br>
	I took a chance and changed your way of life<br>
	But you misread my meaning when I met you <br>
	Close the door and left me blind by the light
</p>

	<strong>Don't let the sun go down on me</strong><br>
	<em>Although I search myself it's always someone else I see <br>
	I'd just allow a fragment of your life<br>
	To wander free</em><br>
	By losing everything is like the sun going down on me
</p>

<section>
<p>
	I can't find oh the right romantic line<br>
	But see me once and see the way I feel<br>
	Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm<br>
	But these cuts I have oh they need love to help them heal<br>
